	<h3>
		My Opinion about HHVM and Hacklang
	</h3>
	<p>
		I never use both technologies but here's my perspective<br>
		after I briefly searched for the informations.<br>
		In my opinion HHVM great for manage a Website that receives a large volume of concurrent hits because<br>
		HHVM requires less memory space to execute requests.<br>
		also because Facebook uses HHVM, they are constantly working to improve it,<br>
		so developers have dependable community support.
	</p>
	</br>
	<h3>
		Things should we consider before migrating
	</h3>
	<p>
		1. Because Facebook uses HHVM, </br>
		In the unlikely event that Facebook discontinues support for HHVM, </br>
		the large development and support community would cease to exist.</br>
		</br>
		2. For developers who have been using PHP for years, HHVM will feel very unfamiliar, </br>
		so there's learning curve to overcome.</br>
		because developers will learn again know how to set it up, configure, and code with it.
